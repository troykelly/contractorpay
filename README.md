# Contractor Pay Estimator

This repository contains a simple static web application that helps Australian contractors estimate how much of their invoiced income they should set aside for tax and GST.

The application is completely client side and can be hosted with GitHub Pages. It allows you to input your daily rate, estimated working days in a period, GST rate and an approximate contractor tax rate. The tool then calculates your income before GST, the GST portion, an estimate of tax to set aside and the approximate amount you might bank after reserving tax.

> **Disclaimer**: This tool provides an approximate estimation only and does not constitute financial advice. Always seek professional financial advice for your specific circumstances.

Future improvements may include automatic working day calculations for each Australian state and territory, more detailed tax rate handling and additional configuration options.
